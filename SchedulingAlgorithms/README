/*
    Ce projet consiste a implementer les algorithmes d'ordonancement suivants en Java:
       1) First-come, first-served (FCFS), which schedules tasks in the order in which
          they request the CPU.
       2) Shortest-job-first (SJF), which schedules tasks in order of the length of the
          tasksâ€™ next CPU burst.
       3) Priority scheduling, which schedules tasks based on priority.
       4) Round-robin (RR) scheduling, where each task is run for a time quantum
          (or for the remainder of its CPU burst).
       5) Priority with round-robin, which schedules tasks in order of priority and
          uses round-robin scheduling for tasks with equal priority.
*/

/*
       The schedule of tasks has the form [task name] [priority] [CPU burst]
       Example:
       T1, 4, 20
       T2, 2, 25
       T3, 3, 25
       T4, 3, 15
       T5, 10, 10
